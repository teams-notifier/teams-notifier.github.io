Once the application is setup and available in MS Teams, the bot has to be invited group chat and channels to get `conversation_token`.
Each `conversation_token` is personal and tied to a user and a conversation (group chat or channel). 

Two different people will have two different token for the same group chat.

These conversation tokens, while linked to specific users, do not require Microsoft licenses to function.

In future versions, users will be able to generate multiple tokens for each conversation. This will allow them to assign different tokens to different applications, making it easier to manage notifications sent to specific channels.
